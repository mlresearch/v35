	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<div id="abstract">
		<p>We study the problem of approximating and learning coverage functions. A function <span class="math">\(c: 2^{[n]} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^{+}\)</span> is a coverage function, if there exists a universe <span class="math">\(U\)</span> with non-negative weights <span class="math">\(w(u)\)</span> for each <span class="math">\(u \in U\)</span> and subsets <span class="math">\(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n\)</span> of <span class="math">\(U\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(c(S) = \sum_{u \in \cup_{i \in S} A_i} w(u)\)</span>. Alternatively, coverage functions can be described as non-negative linear combinations of monotone disjunctions. They are a natural subclass of submodular functions and arise in a number of applications.</p>
<p>We give an algorithm that for any <span class="math">\(\gamma,\delta&gt;0\)</span>, given random and uniform examples of an unknown coverage function <span class="math">\(c\)</span>, finds a function <span class="math">\(h\)</span> that approximates <span class="math">\(c\)</span> within factor <span class="math">\(1+\gamma\)</span> on all but <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>-fraction of the points in time <span class="math">\(poly(n,1/\gamma,1/\delta)\)</span>. This is the first fully-polynomial algorithm for learning an interesting class of functions in the demanding PMAC model of Balcan and Harvey (2011). Our algorithms are based on several new structural properties of coverage functions. Using the results in (Feldman and Kothari, 2014), we also show that coverage functions are learnable agnostically with excess <span class="math">\(\ell_1\)</span>-error <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> over all product and symmetric distributions in time <span class="math">\(n^{\log(1/\epsilon)}\)</span>. In contrast, we show that, without assumptions on the distribution, learning coverage functions is at least as hard as learning polynomial-size disjoint DNF formulas, a class of functions for which the best known algorithm runs in time <span class="math">\(2^{\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})}\)</span> (Klivans and Servedio, 2004).</p>
<p>As an application of our learning results, we give simple differentially-private algorithms for releasing monotone conjunction counting queries with low <span><em>average</em></span> error. In particular, for any <span class="math">\(k \leq n\)</span>, we obtain private release of <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-way marginals with average error <span class="math">\(\bar{\alpha}\)</span> in time <span class="math">\(n^{O(\log(1/\bar{\alpha}))}\)</span>.</p>
