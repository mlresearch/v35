title: On the Consistency of Output Code Based Learning Algorithms for Multiclass
  Learning Problems
abstract: 'A popular approach to solving multiclass learning problems is to reduce
  them to a set of binary classification problems through some output code matrix:
  the widely used one-vs-all and all-pairs methods, and the error-correcting output
  code methods of Dietterich and Bakiri (1995), can all be viewed as special cases
  of this approach. In this paper, we consider the question of statistical consistency
  of such methods. We focus on settings where the binary problems are solved by minimizing
  a binary surrogate loss, and derive general conditions on the binary surrogate loss
  under which the one-vs-all and all-pairs code matrices yield consistent algorithms
  with respect to the multiclass 0-1 loss. We then consider general multiclass learning
  problems defined by a general multiclass loss, and derive conditions on the output
  code matrix and binary surrogates under which the resulting algorithm is consistent
  with respect to the target multiclass loss. We also consider \emphprobabilistic
  code matrices, where one reduces a multiclass problem to a set of \emphclass probability
  labeled binary problems, and show that these can yield benefits in the sense of
  requiring a smaller number of binary problems to achieve overall consistency. Our
  analysis makes interesting connections with the theory of proper composite losses
  (Buja et al., 2005; Reid and Williamson, 2010); these play a role in constructing
  the right ‘decoding’ for converting the predictions on the binary problems to the
  final multiclass prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first work that comprehensively
  studies consistency properties of output code based methods for multiclass learning.'
