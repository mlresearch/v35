title: Faster and Sample Near-Optimal Algorithms for Proper Learning Mixtures of Gaussians
abstract: 'We provide an algorithm for properly learning mixtures of two single-dimensional
  Gaussians without any separability assumptions. Given \tildeO(1/\varepsilon^2) samples
  from an unknown mixture, our algorithm outputs a mixture that is \varepsilon-close
  in total variation distance, in time \tildeO(1/\varepsilon^5). Our sample complexity
  is optimal up to logarithmic factors, and significantly improves upon both Kalai
  et al., whose algorithm has a prohibitive dependence on 1/\varepsilon, and Feldman
  et al., whose algorithm requires bounds on the mixture parameters and depends pseudo-polynomially
  in these parameters. One of our main contributions is an improved and generalized
  algorithm for selecting a good candidate distribution from among competing hypotheses.
  Namely, given a collection of N hypotheses containing at least one candidate that
  is \varepsilon-close to an unknown distribution, our algorithm outputs a candidate
  which is O(\varepsilon)-close to the  distribution. The algorithm requires O(\logN/\varepsilon^2)
  samples from the unknown distribution and O(N \log N/\varepsilon^2) time, which
  improves previous such results (such as the Scheff√© estimator) from a quadratic
  dependence of the running time on N to quasilinear. Given the wide use of such results
  for the purpose of hypothesis selection, our improved algorithm implies immediate
  improvements to any such use. '
