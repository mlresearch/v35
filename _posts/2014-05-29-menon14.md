title: Bayes-Optimal Scorers for Bipartite Ranking
abstract: 'We address the following seemingly simple question: what is the Bayes-optimal
  scorer for a bipartite ranking risk? The answer to this question helps establish
  the consistency of the minimisation of surrogate bipartite risks, and elucidates
  the relationship between bipartite ranking and other established learning problems.
  We show that the answer is non-trivial in general, but may be easily determined
  for certain special cases using the theory of proper losses. Our analysis immediately
  establishes equivalences between several seemingly disparate risks for bipartite
  ranking, such as minimising a suitable class-probability estimation risk, and minimising
  the p-norm push risk proposed by Rudin (2009).'
