title: Online Linear Optimization via Smoothing
abstract: We present a new optimization-theoretic approach to analyzing Follow-the-Leader
  style algorithms, particularly in the setting where perturbations are used as a
  tool for regularization. We show that adding a strongly convex penalty function
  to the decision rule and adding stochastic perturbations to data correspond to deterministic
  and stochastic smoothing operations, respectively. We establish an equivalence between
  “Follow the Regularized Leader” and “Follow the Perturbed Leader” up to the smoothness
  properties. This intuition leads to a new generic analysis framework that recovers
  and improves the previous known regret bounds of the class of algorithms commonly
  known as Follow the Perturbed Leader.
