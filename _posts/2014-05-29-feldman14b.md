title: Sample Complexity Bounds on Differentially Private Learning via Communication
  Complexity
abstract: 'In this work we analyze the sample complexity of classification by differentially
  private algorithms. Differential privacy is a strong and well-studied notion of
  privacy introduced by Dwork et al. (2006) that ensures that the output of an algorithm
  leaks little information about the data point provided by any of the participating
  individuals. Sample complexity of private PAC and agnostic learning was studied
  in a number of prior works starting with (Kasiviswanathan et al., 2008) but a number
  of basic questions still remain open (Beimel et al. 2010; Chaudhuri and Hsu, 2011;
  Beimel et al., 2013a,b). Our main contribution is an equivalence between the sample
  complexity of differentially-private learning of a concept class C (or \mathrmSCDP(C))
  and the randomized one-way communication complexity of the evaluation problem for
  concepts from C. Using this equivalence we prove the following bounds: \beginitemize
  \item \mathrmSCDP(C) = Ω(\mathrmLDim(C)), where \mathrmLDim(C) is the Littlestone’s
  (1987) dimension characterizing the number of mistakes in the online-mistake-bound
  learning model. This result implies that \mathrmSCDP(C) is different from the VC-dimension
  of C, resolving one of the main open questions from prior work. \item For any t,
  there exists a class C such that \mathrmLDim(C)=2 but \mathrmSCDP(C) ≥t. \item For
  any t, there exists a class C such that the sample complexity of (pure) α-differentially
  private PAC learning is Ω(t/α) but the sample complexity of the relaxed (α,β)-differentially
  private PAC learning is O(\log(1/β)/α). This resolves an open problem from (Beimel
  et al., 2013b). \enditemize We also obtain simpler proofs for a number of known
  related results. Our equivalence builds on a characterization of sample complexity
  by Beimel et al., (2013a) and our bounds rely on a number of known results from
  communication complexity.'
