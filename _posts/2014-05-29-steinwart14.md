title: Elicitation and Identification of Properties
abstract: Properties of distributions are real-valued functionals such as the mean,
  quantile or conditional value at risk. A property is elicitable if there exists
  a  scoring function such that minimization of the associated risks recovers the
  property. We extend existing results to characterize the elicitability of properties
  in a general setting. We further relate elicitability to identifiability (a notion
  introduced by Osband) and provide a general formula describing all scoring functions
  for an elicitable property. Finally, we draw some connections to the theory of coherent
  risk measures.
