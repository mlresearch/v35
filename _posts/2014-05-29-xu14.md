title: 'Edge Label Inference in Generalized Stochastic Block Models: from Spectral
  Theory to Impossibility Results'
abstract: 'The classical setting of community detection consists of networks exhibiting
  a clustered structure. To more accurately model real systems we consider a class
  of networks (i) whose edges may carry labels and (ii) which may lack a clustered
  structure. Specifically we assume that nodes possess latent attributes drawn from
  a general compact space and edges between two nodes are randomly generated and labeled
  according to some unknown distribution as a function of their latent attributes.
  Our goal is then to infer the edge label distributions from a partially observed
  network. We propose a computationally efficient spectral algorithm and show it allows
  for asymptotically correct inference when the average node degree could be as low
  as logarithmic in the total number of nodes. Conversely, if the average node degree
  is below a specific constant threshold, we show that no algorithm can achieve better
  inference than guessing without using the observations. As a byproduct of our analysis,
  we show that our model provides a general procedure to construct random graph models
  with a spectrum asymptotic to a pre-specified eigenvalue distribution such as a
  power-law distribution. '
