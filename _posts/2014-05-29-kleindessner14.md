title: Uniqueness of Ordinal Embedding
abstract: "Ordinal embedding refers to the following problem: all we know about an
  unknown set of \t \t\tpoints x_1,\\ldots, x_n ∈\\mathbbR^d are ordinal constraints
  of the form \\|x_i - x_j\\| < \\|x_k - x_l\\|; the task is to construct a realization
  y_1,\\ldots, y_n ∈\\mathbbR^d that preserves these ordinal constraints. It has been
  conjectured since the 1960ies that upon knowledge of all ordinal constraints a large
  but finite set of points can be approximately reconstructed up to a similarity transformation.
  The main result of our paper is a formal proof of this conjecture."
