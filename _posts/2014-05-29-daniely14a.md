title: The Complexity of Learning Halfspaces using Generalized Linear Methods
abstract: Many popular learning algorithms (E.g. Regression, Fourier-Transform based
  algorithms, Kernel SVM and Kernel ridge regression) operate by reducing the problem
  to a convex optimization problem over a set of functions. These methods offer the
  currently best approach to several central problems such as learning half spaces
  and learning DNF’s. In addition they are widely used in numerous application domains.
  Despite their importance, there are still very few proof techniques to show limits
  on the power of these algorithms. We study the performance of this approach in the
  problem of (agnostically and improperly) learning halfspaces with margin γ. Let
  D be a distribution over labeled examples. The γ-margin error of a hyperplane h
  is the probability of an example to fall on the wrong side of h or at a distance
  \leγfrom it. The γ-margin error of the best h is denoted \mathrmErr_γ(D).  An α(γ)-approximation
  algorithm receives γ,εas input and, using i.i.d. samples of D, outputs a classifier
  with error rate \le α(γ)\mathrmErr_γ(D) + ε.  Such an algorithm is efficient if
  it uses \mathrmpoly(\frac1γ,\frac1ε) samples and runs in time polynomial in the
  sample size. The best approximation ratio achievable by an efficient algorithm is
  O\left(\frac1/γ\sqrt\log(1/γ)\right) and is achieved using an algorithm from the
  above class. Our main result shows that the approximation ratio of every efficient
  algorithm from this family must be \ge Ω\left(\frac1/γ\mathrmpoly\left(\log\left(1/γ\right)\right)\right),
  essentially matching the best known upper bound.
