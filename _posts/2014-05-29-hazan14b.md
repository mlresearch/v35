title: 'Volumetric Spanners: an Efficient Exploration Basis for Learning '
abstract: 'Numerous machine learning problems require an \it exploration basis - a
  mechanism to explore the action space. We define a novel geometric notion of exploration
  basis with low variance called volumetric spanners, and give efficient algorithms
  to construct such bases. We show how efficient volumetric spanners give rise to
  an efficient and near-optimal regret algorithm for bandit linear optimization over
  general convex sets. Previously such results were known only for specific convex
  sets, or under special conditions such as the existence of an efficient self-concordant
  barrier for the underlying set. '
