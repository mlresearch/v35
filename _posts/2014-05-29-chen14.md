title: 'A Convex Formulation for Mixed Regression with Two Components: Minimax Optimal
  Rates'
abstract: We consider the mixed regression problem with two components, under adversarial
  and stochastic noise. We give a convex optimization formulation that provably recovers
  the true solution, and provide upper bounds on the recovery errors for both arbitrary
  noise and stochastic noise settings. We also give matching minimax lower bounds
  (up to log factors), showing that under certain assumptions, our algorithm is information-theoretically
  optimal. Our results represent the first (and currently only known) tractable algorithm
  guaranteeing successful recovery with tight bounds on recovery errors and sample
  complexity.
