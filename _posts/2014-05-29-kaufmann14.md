title: On the Complexity of A/B Testing
abstract: A/B testing refers to the task of determining the best option among two
  alternatives that yield random outcomes. We provide distribution-dependent lower
  bounds for the performance of A/B testing that improve over the results currently
  available both in the fixed-confidence (or δ-PAC) and fixed-budget settings. When
  the distribution of the outcomes are Gaussian, we prove that the complexity of the
  fixed-confidence and fixed-budget settings are equivalent, and that uniform sampling
  of both alternatives is optimal only in the case of equal variances. In the common
  variance case, we also provide a stopping rule that terminates faster than existing
  fixed-confidence algorithms. In the case of Bernoulli distributions, we show that
  the complexity of fixed-budget setting is smaller than that of fixed-confidence
  setting and that uniform sampling of both alternatives—though not optimal—is advisable
  in practice when combined with an appropriate stopping criterion.
