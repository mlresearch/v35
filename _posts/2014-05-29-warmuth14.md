title: 'Open Problem: Shifting Experts on Easy Data'
abstract: A number of online algorithms have been developed that have small additional
  loss (regret) compared to the best “shifting expert”. In this model, there is a
  set of experts and the comparator is the best partition of the trial sequence into
  a small number of segments, where the expert of smallest loss is chosen in each
  segment. The regret is typically defined for worst-case data / loss sequences. There
  has been a recent surge of interest in online algorithms that combine good worst-case
  guarantees with much improved performance on easy data. A practically relevant class
  of easy data is the case when the loss of each expert is iid and the best and second
  best experts have a gap between their mean loss. In the full information setting,
  the FlipFlop algorithm by De Rooij et al. (2014) combines the best of the iid optimal
  Follow-The-Leader (FL) and the worst-case-safe Hedge algorithms, whereas in the
  bandit information case SAO by Bubeck and Slivkins (2012) competes with the iid
  optimal UCB and the worst-case-safe EXP3. We ask the same question for the shifting
  expert problem. First, we ask what are the simple and efficient algorithms for the
  shifting experts problem when the loss sequence in each segment is iid with respect
  to a fixed but unknown distribution. Second, we ask how to efficiently unite the
  performance of such algorithms on easy data with worst-case robustness. A particular
  intriguing open problem is the case when the comparator shifts within a small subset
  of experts from a large set under the assumption that the losses in each segment
  are iid.
