title: 'Open Problem: A (missing) boosting-type convergence result for \textsc{AdaBoost.MH}
  with factorized multi-class classifiers'
abstract: In (Kégl, 2014), we recently showed empirically that \textscAdaBoost.MH
  is one of the best multi-class boosting algorithms when the classical one-against-all
  base classifiers, proposed in the seminal paper of Schapire and Singer (1999), are
  replaced by factorized base classifiers containing a binary classifier and a vote
  (or code) vector. In a slightly different setup, a similar factorization coupled
  with an iterative optimization of the two factors also proved to be an excellent
  approach (Gao and Koller, 2011). The main algorithmic advantage of our approach
  over the original setup of Schapire and Singer (1999) is that trees can be built
  in a straightforward way by using the binary classifier at inner nodes. In this
  open problem paper we take a step back to the basic setup of boosting generic multi-class
  factorized (Hamming) classifiers (so no trees), and state the classical problem
  of boosting-like convergence of the training error. Given a vote vector, training
  the classifier leads to a standard weighted binary classification problem. The main
  difficulty of proving the convergence is that, unlike in binary \textscAdaBoost,
  the sum of the weights in this weighted binary classification problem is less than
  one, which means that the lower bound on the edge, coming from the weak learning
  condition, shrinks. To show the convergence, we need a (uniform) lower bound on
  the sum of the weights in this derived binary classification problem.
