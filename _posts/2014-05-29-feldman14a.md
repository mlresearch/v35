title: Learning Coverage Functions and Private Release of Marginals
abstract: 'We study the problem of approximating and learning coverage functions.
  A function c: 2^[n] →\mathbfR^+ is a coverage function, if there exists a universe
  U with non-negative weights w(u) for each u ∈U and subsets A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n
  of U such that c(S) = \sum_u ∈\cup_i ∈S A_i w(u). Alternatively, coverage functions
  can be described as non-negative linear combinations of monotone disjunctions. They
  are a natural subclass of submodular functions and arise in a number of applications.
  We give an algorithm that for any γ,δ>0, given random and uniform examples of an
  unknown coverage function c, finds a function h that approximates c within factor
  1+γon all but δ-fraction of the points in time poly(n,1/γ,1/δ). This is the first
  fully-polynomial algorithm for learning an interesting class of functions in the
  demanding PMAC model of Balcan and Harvey (2011). Our algorithms are based on several
  new structural properties of coverage functions. Using the results in (Feldman and
  Kothari, 2014), we also show that coverage functions are learnable agnostically
  with excess \ell_1-error εover all product and symmetric distributions in time n^\log(1/ε).
  In contrast, we show that, without assumptions on the distribution, learning coverage
  functions is at least as hard as learning polynomial-size disjoint DNF formulas,
  a class of functions for which the best known algorithm runs in time 2^\tildeO(n^1/3)
  (Klivans and Servedio, 2004). As an application of our learning results, we give
  simple differentially-private algorithms for releasing monotone conjunction counting
  queries with low \em average error. In particular, for any k ≤n, we obtain private
  release of k-way marginals with average error \barα in time n^O(\log(1/\barα)). '
