title: Community Detection via Random and Adaptive Sampling
abstract: In this paper, we consider networks consisting of a finite number of non-overlapping
  communities. To extract these communities, the interaction between pairs of nodes
  may be sampled from a large available data set, which allows a given node pair to
  be sampled several times. When a node pair is sampled, the observed outcome is a
  binary random variable, equal to 1 if nodes interact and to 0 otherwise. The outcome
  is more likely to be positive if nodes belong to the same communities. For a given
  budget of node pair samples or observations, we wish to jointly design a sampling
  strategy (the sequence of sampled node pairs) and a clustering algorithm that recover
  the hidden communities with the highest possible accuracy. We consider both non-adaptive
  and adaptive sampling strategies, and for both classes of strategies, we derive
  fundamental performance limits satisfied by any sampling and clustering algorithm.
  In particular, we provide necessary conditions for the existence of algorithms recovering
  the communities accurately as the network size grows large. We also devise simple
  algorithms that accurately reconstruct the communities when this is at all possible,
  hence proving that the proposed necessary conditions for accurate community detection
  are also sufficient. The classical problem of community detection in the stochastic
  block model can be seen as a particular instance of the problems consider here.
  But our framework covers more general scenarios where the sequence of sampled node
  pairs can be designed in an adaptive manner. The paper provides new results for
  the stochastic block model, and extends the analysis to the case of adaptive sampling.
