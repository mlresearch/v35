title: Localized Complexities for Transductive Learning
abstract: We show two novel concentration inequalities for suprema of empirical processes
  when sampling without replacement, which both take the variance of the functions
  into account. While these inequalities may potentially have broad applications in
  learning theory in general, we exemplify their significance by studying the transductive
  setting of learning theory. For which we provide the first excess risk bounds based
  on the localized complexity of the hypothesis class, which can yield fast rates
  of convergence also in the transductive learning setting. We give a preliminary
  analysis of the localized complexities for the prominent case of kernel classes.
