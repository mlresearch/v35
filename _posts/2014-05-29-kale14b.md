title: 'Open Problem: Efficient Online Sparse Regression'
abstract: In practical scenarios, it is often necessary to be able to make predictions
  with very limited access to the features of any example. We provide one natural
  formulation as an online sparse regression problem with squared loss, and ask whether
  it is possible to achieve sublinear regret with efficient algorithms (i.e. polynomial
  running time in the natural parameters of the problem).
