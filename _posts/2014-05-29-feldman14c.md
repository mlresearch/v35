title: 'Open Problem: The Statistical Query Complexity of Learning Sparse Halfspaces'
abstract: 'We consider the long-open problem of attribute-efficient learning of halfspaces.
  In this problem the learner is given random examples labeled by an unknown halfspace
  function f on \mathbbR^n. Further f is r-sparse, that is it depends on at most r
  out of n variables. An attribute-efficient learning algorithm is an algorithm that
  can output a hypothesis close to f using a polynomial in r and \log n number of
  examples (Blum, 1992). Despite a number of attempts and some partial progress, there
  are no efficient algorithms or hardness results for the problem. We propose a potentially
  easier question: what is the query complexity of this learning problem in the statistical
  query (SQ) model of Kearns (1998). We show that, as in the case of general PAC learning,
  the query complexity of attribute-efficient SQ learning of any concept class can
  be characterized by a combinatorial parameter of the concept class. The proposed
  question is then equivalent to estimating the value of this parameter for the concept
  class of halfspaces. A potentially simpler problem is to estimate this parameter
  for the concept class of decision lists, a subclass of halfspaces.'
