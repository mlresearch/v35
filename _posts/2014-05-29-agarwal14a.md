title: Learning Sparsely Used Overcomplete Dictionaries
abstract: 'We consider the problem of learning sparsely used overcomplete dictionaries,
  where each observation is  a sparse combination of elements from an unknown overcomplete
  dictionary. We establish exact recovery when the dictionary elements are mutually
  incoherent. Our method consists of a clustering-based initialization step, which
  provides an approximate estimate   of the true dictionary with guaranteed accuracy.
  This estimate is then refined via an iterative algorithm with the following alternating
  steps: 1) estimation of the dictionary coefficients for each observation through
  \ell_1 minimization, given the dictionary estimate, and 2) estimation of the dictionary
  elements through least squares, given the coefficient estimates. We establish that,
  under a set of sufficient conditions, our method converges at a linear rate to the
  true dictionary as well as the true coefficients for each observation.'
