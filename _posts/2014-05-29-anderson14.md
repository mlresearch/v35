title: 'The More, the Merrier: the Blessing of Dimensionality for Learning Large Gaussian
  Mixtures'
abstract: 'In this paper we show that very large mixtures of Gaussians are efficiently
  learnable in high dimension. More precisely, we prove that a mixture with known
  identical covariance matrices whose number of components is a polynomial of any
  fixed degree in the dimension n is polynomially learnable as long as a certain non-degeneracy
  condition on the means is satisfied. It turns out that this condition is generic
  in the sense of smoothed complexity, as soon as the dimensionality of the space
  is high enough. Moreover, we prove that no such condition can possibly exist in
  low dimension and the problem of learning the parameters is generically hard.  In
  contrast, much of the existing work on Gaussian Mixtures relies on low-dimensional
  projections and thus hits an artificial barrier. Our main result on mixture recovery
  relies on a new “Poissonization"-based technique, which transforms a mixture of
  Gaussians to a linear map of a product distribution. The problem of learning this
  map can be efficiently solved using some recent results on tensor decompositions
  and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), thus giving an  algorithm for recovering
  the mixture. In addition, we combine our low-dimensional hardness results for Gaussian
  mixtures with  Poissonization to show how to embed difficult instances of low-dimensional
  Gaussian mixtures into the ICA setting, thus establishing exponential information-theoretic
  lower bounds for underdetermined ICA in low dimension. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first such result  in the literature. In addition to contributing to  the
  problem of Gaussian mixture learning, we believe that this work is among the first
  steps toward better understanding the rare phenomenon of the “blessing of dimensionality"
  in the computational aspects of statistical inference. '
