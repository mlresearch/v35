title: 'Open Problem: Finding Good Cascade Sampling Processes for the Network Inference
  Problem'
abstract: Information spreads across social and technological networks, but often
  the network structures are hidden and we only observe the traces left by the diffusion
  processes, called cascades. It is known that, under a popular continuous-time diffusion
  model, as long as the model parameters satisfy a natural incoherence condition,
  it is possible to recover the correct network structure with high probability if
  we observe O(d^3 \log N) cascades, where d is the maximum number of parents of a
  node and N is the total number of nodes. However, the incoherence condition depends,
  in a non-trivial way, on the source (node) distribution of the cascades, which is
  typically unknown. Our open problem is whether it is possible to design an active
  algorithm which samples the source locations in a sequential manner and achieves
  the same or even better sample complexity, e.g., o(d_i^3 \log N), than previous
  work.
