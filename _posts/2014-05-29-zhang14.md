title: Lower bounds on the performance of polynomial-time algorithms for sparse linear
  regression
abstract: Under a standard assumption in complexity theory (NP not in P/poly), we
  demonstrate a gap between the minimax prediction risk for sparse linear regression
  that can be achieved by polynomial-time algorithms, and that achieved by optimal
  algorithms.  In particular, when the design matrix is ill-conditioned, the minimax
  prediction loss achievable by polynomial-time algorithms can be substantially greater
  than that of an optimal algorithm.  This result is the first known gap between polynomial
  and optimal algorithms for sparse linear regression, and does not depend on conjectures
  in average-case complexity.
