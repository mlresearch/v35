title: Belief propagation, robust reconstruction and optimal recovery of block models
abstract: 'We consider the problem of reconstructing sparse symmetric block models
  with two blocks and connection probabilities a/n and b/n for inter- and intra-block
  edge probabilities respectively. It was recently shown that one can do better than
  a random guess if and only if (a-b)^2 > 2(a+b). Using a variant of Belief Propagation,
  we give a reconstruction algorithm that is \emphoptimal in the sense that if (a-b)^2
  > C (a+b) for some constant C then our algorithm maximizes the fraction of the nodes
  labelled correctly. Along the way we prove some results of independent interest
  regarding \em robust reconstruction for the Ising model on regular and Poisson trees. '
