title: 'Unconstrained Online Linear Learning in Hilbert Spaces: Minimax Algorithms
  and Normal Approximations'
abstract: We study algorithms for online linear optimization in Hilbert spaces, focusing
  on the case where the player is unconstrained.  We develop a novel characterization
  of a large class of minimax algorithms, recovering, and even improving, several
  previous results as immediate corollaries.  Moreover, using our tools, we develop
  an algorithm that provides a regret bound of O(U \sqrtT \log( U \sqrtT \log^2 T
  +1)), where U is the L_2 norm of an arbitrary comparator and both T and U are unknown
  to the player. This bound is optimal up to \sqrt\log \log T terms.  When T is known,
  we derive an algorithm with an optimal regret bound (up to constant factors).  For
  both the known and unknown T case, a Normal approximation to the conditional value
  of the game proves to be the key analysis tool.
