title: Online Learning with Composite Loss Functions
abstract: We study a new class of online learning problems where each of the online
  algorithm’s actions is assigned an adversarial value, and the loss of the algorithm
  at each step is a known and deterministic function of the values assigned to its
  recent actions. This class includes problems where the algorithm’s loss is the \emphminimum
  over the recent adversarial values, the \emphmaximum over the recent values, or
  a \emphlinear combination of the recent values. We analyze the minimax regret of
  this class of problems when the algorithm receives bandit feedback, and prove that
  when the    \emphminimum or \emphmaximum functions are used, the minimax regret
  is \widetilde Ω(T^2/3) (so called \emphhard online learning problems), and when
  a linear function is used, the minimax regret is \widetilde O(\sqrtT) (so called
  \empheasy learning problems). Previously, the only online learning problem that
  was known to be provably hard was the multi-armed bandit with switching costs.
