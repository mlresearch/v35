title: Online Non-Parametric Regression
abstract: We establish optimal rates for online regression for arbitrary classes of
  regression functions in terms of the sequential entropy introduced in (Rakhlin et
  al., 2010). The optimal rates are shown to exhibit a phase transition analogous
  to the i.i.d./statistical learning case, studied in  (Rakhlin et al., 2014b). In
  the frequently encountered situation when sequential entropy and i.i.d. empirical
  entropy match, our results point to the interesting phenomenon that the rates for
  statistical learning with squared loss and online nonparametric regression are the
  same. In addition to a non-algorithmic study of minimax regret, we exhibit a generic
  forecaster that enjoys the established optimal rates. We also provide a recipe for
  designing online regression algorithms that can be computationally efficient. We
  illustrate the techniques by deriving existing and new forecasters for the case
  of finite experts and for online linear regression.
