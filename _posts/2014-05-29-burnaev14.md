title: Efficiency of conformalized ridge regression
abstract: Conformal prediction is a method of producing prediction sets that can be
  applied on top of a wide range of prediction algorithms. The method has a guaranteed
  coverage probability under the standard IID assumption regardless of whether the
  assumptions (often considerably more restrictive) of the underlying algorithm are
  satisfied. However, for the method to be really useful it is desirable that in the
  case where the assumptions of the underlying algorithm are satisfied, the conformal
  predictor loses little in efficiency as compared with the underlying algorithm (whereas
  being a conformal predictor, it has the stronger guarantee of validity). In this
  paper we explore the degree to which this additional requirement of efficiency is
  satisfied in the case of Bayesian ridge regression; we find that asymptotically
  conformal prediction sets differ little from ridge regression prediction intervals
  when the standard Bayesian assumptions are satisfied.
