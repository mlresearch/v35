title: Computational Limits for Matrix Completion
abstract: Matrix Completion is the problem of recovering an unknown real-valued low-rank
  matrix from a subsample of its entries. Important recent results show that the problem
  can be solved efficiently under the assumption that the unknown matrix is incoherent
  and the subsample is drawn uniformly at random. Are these assumptions necessary?
  It is well known that Matrix Completion in its full generality is NP-hard. However,
  little is known if we make additional assumptions such as incoherence and permit
  the algorithm to output a matrix of slightly higher rank. In this paper we prove
  that Matrix Completion remains computationally intractable even if the unknown matrix
  has rankÂ 4 but we are allowed to output any constant rank matrix, and even if additionally
  we assume that the unknown  matrix is incoherent and are shown 90% of the entries.
  This result relies on the conjectured hardness of the 4-Coloring problem. We also
  consider the positive semidefinite Matrix Completion problem. Here we show a similar
  hardness result under the standard assumption that \mathrmP\ne \mathrmNP. Our results
  greatly narrow the gap between existing feasibility results and computational lower
  bounds. In particular, we believe that our results give the first complexity-theoretic
  justification for why distributional assumptions are needed beyond the incoherence
  assumption in order to obtain positive results. On the technical side, we contribute
  several new ideas on how to encode hard combinatorial problems in low-rank optimization
  problems. We hope that these techniques will be helpful in further understanding
  the computational limits of Matrix Completion and related problems.
