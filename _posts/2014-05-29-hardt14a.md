title: Fast matrix completion without the condition number
abstract: 'We give the first algorithm for Matrix Completion that achieves running
  time and sample complexity that is polynomial in the rank of the unknown target
  matrix, \emphlinear in the dimension of the matrix, and \emphlogarithmic in the
  condition number of the matrix.  To the best of our knowledge, all previous algorithms
  either incurred a quadratic dependence on the condition number of the unknown matrix
  or a quadratic dependence on the dimension of the matrix. Our algorithm is based
  on a novel extension of Alternating Minimization which we show has theoretical guarantees
  under standard assumptions even in the presence of noise. '
