title: An Inequality with Applications to Structured Sparsity and Multitask Dictionary
  Learning
abstract: From concentration inequalities for the suprema of Gaussian or Rademacher
  processes an inequality is derived. It is applied to sharpen existing and to derive
  novel bounds on the empirical Rademacher complexities of unit balls in various norms
  appearing in the context of structured sparsity and multitask dictionary learning
  or matrix factorization. A key role is played by the largest eigenvalue of the data
  covariance matrix.
