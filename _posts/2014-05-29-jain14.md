title: Learning Mixtures of Discrete Product Distributions using Spectral Decompositions
abstract: 'We study the problem of learning a distribution from samples, when the
  underlying distribution is a mixture of product distributions over discrete domains.
  This problem is motivated by several practical applications such as  crowdsourcing,
  recommendation systems, and learning Boolean functions. The existing solutions either
  heavily rely on the fact that the number of mixtures is finite or have  sample/time
  complexity that is exponential in the number of mixtures. In this paper, we introduce
  a polynomial time/sample complexity  method for learning a mixture of r discrete
  product distributions over {1, 2, â€¦, \ell}^n, for  general \ell and r. We show that
  our approach is consistent and further provide finite sample guarantees. We use
  recently developed techniques from tensor decompositions for moment matching. A
  crucial step  in these approaches is to construct certain  tensors  with low-rank
  spectral decompositions. These tensors are typically estimated from the sample moments.
  The main challenge in learning mixtures of discrete product distributions is that  the
  corresponding low-rank tensors cannot be obtained directly from the sample moments.
  Instead, we need to estimate a low-rank matrix using only off-diagonal entries,
  and estimate a tensor using a few linear measurements. We give an alternating minimization
  based method to estimate the low-rank matrix, and  formulate the tensor estimation
  problem as a least-squares problem. '
