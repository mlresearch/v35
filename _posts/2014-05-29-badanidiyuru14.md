title: Resourceful Contextual Bandits
abstract: We study contextual bandits with ancillary constraints on resources, which
  are common in real-world applications such as choosing ads or dynamic pricing of
  items.  We design the first algorithm for solving these problems that improves over
  a trivial reduction to the non-contextual case. We consider very general settings
  for both contextual bandits (arbitrary policy sets, Dudik et al. (2011)) and bandits
  with resource constraints (bandits with knapsacks,  Badanidiyuru et al. (2013a)),
  and prove a regret guarantee with near-optimal statistical properties.
