title: 'Open Problem: Tightness of maximum likelihood semidefinite relaxations'
abstract: 'We have observed an interesting, yet unexplained, phenomenon: Semidefinite
  programming (SDP) based relaxations of maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) tend
  to be tight in recovery problems with noisy data, even when MLE cannot exactly recover
  the ground truth. Several results establish tightness of SDP based relaxations in
  the regime where exact recovery from MLE is possible. However, to the best of our
  knowledge, their tightness is not understood beyond this regime. As an illustrative
  example, we focus on the generalized Procrustes problem.'
