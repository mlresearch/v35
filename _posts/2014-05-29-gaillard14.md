title: A second-order bound with excess losses
abstract: We study online aggregation of the predictions of experts, and first show
  new second-order regret bounds in the standard setting, which are obtained via a
  version of the Prod algorithm (and also a version of the polynomially weighted average
  algorithm) with multiple learning rates. These bounds are in terms of excess losses,
  the differences between the instantaneous losses suffered by the algorithm and the
  ones of a given expert. We then demonstrate the interest of these bounds in the
  context of experts that report their confidences as a number in the interval [0,1]
  using a generic reduction to the standard setting. We conclude by two other applications
  in the standard setting, which improve the known bounds in case of small excess
  losses and show a bounded regret against i.i.d. sequences of losses.
