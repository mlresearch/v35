title: The sample complexity of agnostic learning under deterministic labels
abstract: With the emergence of Machine Learning tools that allow handling data with
  a huge number of features, it becomes reasonable to assume that, over the full set
  of features, the true labeling is (almost) fully determined. That is, the labeling
  function is deterministic, but not necessarily a member of some known  hypothesis
  class. However, agnostic learning of deterministic labels has so far received little
  research attention. We investigate this setting and show that it displays a behavior
  that is quite different from that of the fundamental results of the common (PAC)
  learning setups. First, we show that the sample complexity of learning a binary
  hypothesis class (with respect to deterministic labeling functions) is not fully
  determined by the VC-dimension of the class. For any d, we present classes of VC-dimension
  d that are learnable from \tilde O(d/ε)-many samples and classes that require samples
  of size Ω(d/ε^2). Furthermore, we show that in this setup, there are classes for
  which any proper learner has suboptimal sample complexity.  While the class can
  be learned with sample complexity \tilde O(d/ε), any \emphproper (and therefore,
  any ERM) algorithm requires Ω(d/ε^2) samples. We provide combinatorial characterizations
  of both phenomena, and further analyze the utility of unlabeled samples in this
  setting. Lastly, we discuss the error rates of nearest neighbor algorithms under
  deterministic labels and additional niceness-of-data assumptions.
