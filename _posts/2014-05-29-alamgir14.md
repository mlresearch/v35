title: Density-preserving quantization with application to graph downsampling
abstract: We consider the problem of vector quantization of i.i.d. samples drawn from
  a density p on \mathbbR^d. It is  desirable that the representatives selected by
  the quantization algorithm have the same distribution p as the original sample points.
  However, quantization algorithms based on Euclidean distance, such as k-means, do
  not have this property. We provide a solution to this problem that takes the unweighted
  k-nearest neighbor graph on the sample as input. In particular, it does not need
  to have access to the data points themselves. Our solution generates quantization
  centers that are “evenly spaced". We exploit this property to downsample geometric
  graphs and show that our method produces  sparse downsampled graphs.  Our algorithm
  is easy to implement, and we provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of
  the proposed algorithm.
