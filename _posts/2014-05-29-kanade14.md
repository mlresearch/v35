title: Distribution-independent Reliable Learning
abstract: 'We study several questions in the \emphreliable agnostic learning framework
  of Kalai et al. (2009), which captures learning tasks in which one type of error
  is costlier than other types. A positive reliable classifier is one that makes no
  false positive errors.  The goal in the \emphpositive reliable agnostic framework
  is to output a hypothesis with the following properties: (i) its false positive
  error rate is at most ε, (ii) its false negative error rate is at most εmore than
  that of the best positive reliable classifier from the class.  A closely related
  notion is \emphfully reliable agnostic learning, which considers \emphpartial classifiers
  that are allowed to predict “unknown” on some inputs. The best fully reliable partial
  classifier is one that makes no errors and minimizes the probability of predicting
  “unknown”, and the goal in fully reliable learning is to output a hypothesis that
  is almost as good as the best fully reliable partial classifier from a class. For
  distribution-independent learning,  the best known algorithms for PAC learning typically
  utilize polynomial threshold representations, while the state of the art agnostic
  learning algorithms use point-wise polynomial approximations.  We show that \emphone-sided
  polynomial approximations, an intermediate notion between polynomial threshold representations
  and point-wise polynomial approximations, suffice for learning in the reliable agnostic
  settings. We then show that majorities can be fully reliably learned and disjunctions
  of majorities can be positive reliably learned, through constructions of appropriate
  one-sided polynomial approximations.  Our fully reliable algorithm for majorities
  provides the first evidence that fully reliable learning may be strictly easier
  than agnostic learning.  Our algorithms also satisfy strong attribute-efficiency
  properties, and in many cases they provide smooth tradeoffs between sample complexity
  and running time. '
