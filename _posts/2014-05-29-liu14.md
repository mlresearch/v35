title: Most Correlated Arms Identification
abstract: We study the problem of finding the most mutually correlated arms among
  many arms. We show that adaptive arms sampling strategies can have significant advantages
  over the non-adaptive uniform sampling strategy. Our proposed algorithms rely on
  a novel correlation estimator. The use of this accurate estimator allows us to get
  improved results for a wide range of problem instances.
